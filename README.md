In contrast to Node.js modules, webpack modules can express their dependencies
in a variety of ways. A few examples are:

An ES2015 import statement
A CommonJS require() statement
An AMD define and require statement
An @import statement inside of a css/sass/less file.
An image url in a stylesheet (url(...)) or html (<img src=...>) file.
